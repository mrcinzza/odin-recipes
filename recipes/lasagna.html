        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound bulk pork sausage</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
                until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander
                and place over a bowl to drain.</li>
            <li>While squash is baking, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir
                until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, breaking it up with a
                sturdy spoon to remove clumps. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed
                tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.
    
            </li>
            <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the shredded spaghetti squash, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/2 of the meat mixture in a
                4-quart glass baking dish. Repeat layers once more, and top with mozzarella cheese slices.
    
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until cheese is golden, about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
